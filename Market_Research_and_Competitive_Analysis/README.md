#### **Break-Even Analysis with Reduced Costs**

- **Fixed Costs (Year 1):** $250,000 (Operating Expenses) + $75,000 (Development Costs) = **$325,000**
- **Variable Costs per Customer (Year 1):** $50 per month = **$600 per year**.
- **Average Revenue per Customer (Dental Practices - Standard and Premium):** $625 per month = **$7,500 per year**.

**Break-Even Volume (Customers):**  
\[
\text{Break-Even Volume} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Average Revenue per Customer} - \text{Variable Costs per Customer}} = \frac{325,000}{7,500 - 600} \approx 46 \text{ customers}
\]

#### **Conclusion**

With the updated financials reflecting halved operating costs, the business outlook is more favorable:
- **Higher Profit Margins:** Net profits significantly increase each year due to lower operating costs.
- **Lower Break-Even Point:** The business needs fewer customers to break even, reducing financial risk.
- **Improved Cash Flow:** More available funds to reinvest in growth, marketing, and further development.
