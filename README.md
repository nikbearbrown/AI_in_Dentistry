Humanitarians AI ([https://humanitarians.ai/](https://humanitarians.ai/)) is a global network of data scientists and creatives dedicated to developing ethical, innovative, and open-source AI solutions for addressing real-world challenges across science, entrepreneurship, and the arts. We are driven by a commitment to positive change, ensuring that technology is a force for good, accessible to all. Our core values of transparency, efficiency, inclusion, and community guide our efforts to demystify artificial intelligence and create meaningful opportunities that benefit local communities and humanity as a whole.

Many international data scientists and engineers have participated in our volunteer programs and paid post-graduation OPT-eligible fellowship opportunities. We are now eager to broaden these opportunities to include international dental students. Our focus is on expanding career pathways beyond the typical roles, enabling international dentists to collaborate with engineers and software developers to create generative AI tools tailored for dentistry and dental education.
